![Built With Love](./docs/built-with-love.png)

A minimal approach to make a list of awesome algorithms solved in saveral ways with **JavaScript** :rocket:

## Development Mode:
It is quite simple to test any of the `Algorithm`.

üöÄ Example: `node basic-algorithms/palindrome-checker.js`


## ‚úÖ How to Contribute

First: if you feel insecure about how to start contributing, Don't worry -  You can also just go ahead with your contribution and other contriubutors give you feedback. We appreciate any contributions, and we don't want a wall of rules to stand in the way of that.

> Remember, no contribution is too small, and everyone was a rookie at some point in time. From documentation updates to bug fixes or small feature improvements, every pull request has value and helps make the world a better place.

However, first read our [Contribution Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTION.md) and start Hacking :rocket:
